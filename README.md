# Hi, I'm Suryansh Agrawal! 👋

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. I built this site to showcase my journey as a Computer Science student, the real-world software projects I've worked on, and the skills I'm constantly trying to improve.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## ✨ What's Inside?

This portfolio is meant to be simple, clean, and straightforward. Here's what you'll find:

- **My Experience**: Practical learning and training I've completed so far.
- **Featured Projects**: The projects I'm most proud of, including the problems they solve, the tech stacks used, and the key things I learned while building them.
- **My Skills**: A quick breakdown of the languages, frameworks, and tools I use.
- **Certifications & Education**: My academic background and professional certificates.

## 🛠️ Built With

Keeping it clean and dependency-free:
- **HTML5** & **CSS3** (Custom styling, responsive layout)
